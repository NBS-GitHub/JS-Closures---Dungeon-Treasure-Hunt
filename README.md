# JS-Closures---Dungeon-Treasure-Hunt
## Application using fetch API, closures and DOM manipulation.
---
This application was created to test and refresh three kinds of coding skills:
- closures,
- fetch,
- DOM manipulations.

### Fetch
The app gets the data from randomuser.me and displays some of them to the screen.

### Closures
The nested closures structure contains 10 levels. It immitates getting deeper and deeper into the dungeon in search of a treasure.

### DOM manipulations
Tghe DOM manipulations are used at:
- preparing the fetched data to being displayed,
- preparing the message at each level of the dungeon to be displayed.
